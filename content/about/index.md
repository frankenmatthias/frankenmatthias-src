Since February 2023, I am a speech scientist at [NovoLanguage](https://www.novo-learning.com/), where we develop AI technology to support language and literacy education. Our software provides detailed pronunciation feedback and assessment to children learning to read as well as second language learners.

Until January 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [motor neuroscience lab](https://www.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/mcl/Lab-Home.htm) at McGill University (Montreal, Canada), working with [David Ostry](https://www.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/mcl/Davidostry.htm). My core research interests was focused on the neuroscience of speech production and perception, and their interaction.

In order to investigate the sensory-motor aspects of speech, I used a variety of experimental methods, including psychophysical and acoustic measures, electrophysiology (MEG, EEG) and non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS).

Previously, I was a PhD student at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) (Nijmegen, The Netherlands) working with [Peter Hagoort](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/hagoort-p/) and [James McQueen](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/mcqueen-j/). I am also an alumnus of the  [International Max Planck Research School for Language Sciences](https://www.mpi.nl/department/imprs-graduate-school/13). My [dissertation](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/180052) was focused on interactions between speech perception and speech production.

From 2017 to 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Ghent University (Belgium) working with [Rob Hartsuiker](https://users.ugent.be/~rhartsui/), where I focused on the sense of agency in speech.
