Until January 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [motor neuroscience lab](https://www.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/mcl/Lab-Home.htm) at McGill University (Montreal, Canada), working with [David Ostry](https://www.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/mcl/Davidostry.htm). My core research interests was focused on the neuroscience of speech production and perception, and their interaction.

In order to investigate the sensory-motor aspects of speech, I used a variety of experimental methods, including psychophysical and acoustic measures, electrophysiology (MEG, EEG) and non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS).

Previously, I was a PhD student at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) (Nijmegen, The Netherlands) working with [Peter Hagoort](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/hagoort-p/) and [James McQueen](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/mcqueen-j/). I am also an alumnus of the  [International Max Planck Research School for Language Sciences](https://www.mpi.nl/department/imprs-graduate-school/13). My [dissertation](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/180052) was focused on interactions between speech perception and speech production.

From 2017 to 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Ghent University (Belgium) working with [Rob Hartsuiker](https://users.ugent.be/~rhartsui/), where I focused on the sense of agency in speech.
